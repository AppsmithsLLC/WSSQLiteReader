# ${1:WSSQLiteReader}
Prototype dynamic SQLite database reader which currently demonstrates:

* Dynamic form generation using XIBs and custom wrapper classess to abstract complexity away from the UITableViewController subclasses.

* Custom theme patterns

* Usage of FMDatabase to access SQLite database files

## Installation
